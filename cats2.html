                        small hairy ball. I wanted to call them "Boule" or "Grosse boule" ("Ball" or "Big ball", now they are adult)
                        but I thought it was essentializing so I decided to call them a name that includes "boule", such as Ci<em>boule</em>tte. In addition,
                        that's a word that always seemed funny and cute to me. And that's nice in salads.

                        Echalote (shallot in english) is also Charlouse's great sister. Ciboulette and her come from the same litter. Their mother is probably Tulba.
                        Echalote likes to sit in the basket near the garden door. She is brave and wants to eat my meal. I gave her this name because it is in the same theme as Ciboulette and it contains "cha", as in "chat" (cat).

                        Harvey is mean. He bit Hippo's fingers, steals the food from the litte ones and even tried to copulate with one of them once.
                        I tried to make him nice, but look at his frowning and petty eyes and his white strip of hair that looks like a scar... He looks like a bad movie villain and acts like a patriarch...
                        I'll give him a chance if he behaves well.

                        Petite boule (small ball) is from the same litter as Charlouse. Ciboulette is their great sister/brother and they look exactly the same except
                        that Petite boule is smaller. As you can see, I wasn't too inspired for their name. Sometimes I also call them Petit Lion (little lion) ou Petit Dragon (little dragon) because of the hair crown.
                        They like to play football with Petit pois (see below).

                        Petit pois (pea, little pea) is the third kitten of Charlouse and Petite boule's litter. They are daredevil, but still, they won't
                        let themselves be stroked, like any cat of the family. I hope someday they will be less fearful and confident with us.
                        When they were a tiny tiny baby kitten, Roland tried to kidnap them. They were stucked behind the fridge behind three days but nobody knew it.
                        I feel so sad for them... :'( At this time I wanted to give them a survivor name but I had no idea, so it was Rambo or Jungle,
                        but I found these names too generic so I call them Petit pois to stay in a culinary theme. Their ear is tattooed, I don't know what that means.

                        Spatule (spatula) is one of the oldest cats with Harvey. They look like each other, they are probably siblings.
                        Spatule likes to come to the garden door at the evening and look at us cooking, but they are not asking for food. 
                        They are just keeping us company. In the morning, they sleep curled up on a seat on the terrace. It's so relaxing to see.
                        I did'nt know how to call them so I chose a word I like the sound of and still in a culinary theme.

                        Tulba is the mother of Ciboulette and Echalote, and probably Charlouse, Petit pois and Petite boule. She is both fierce and soft. 
                        She is the only one that liked to be stroked, but she always want to steal food and once, with Ciboulette and Echalote, they coordinated
                        to steal my pizza. I wasn't mad because they were so cute and hungry... Unfortunately, I don't see Tulba anymore. I hope nothing bad happened to her.
                        Tulba is the diminutive of Tulbaghia, a nice garden flower. One again, I chose this name because I like its sound, also since
                        she's the mother of most cats of the family I wanted to give her a mystical, strong name.
